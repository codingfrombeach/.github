## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Coding from Beach is a group for geeks who meet once a month to share and learn about programming, making and hacking on hardware.

The purpose of the meetup is to get together, share ideas, best practices, skills and new technologies in a safe, friendly and collaborative environment.

Coding from Beach meets monthly with a curated program of talks as well as catered drinks & pizza.

We meetup at the Peregian Hub in the Sunshine coast.
